# Run the SQL2520CODE(1).py to see how it works
## make sure that the AnalyzingPython.py is in the same directory as the SQL2520CODE(1).py so that it works
## The SQL2520CODE(1).py is created to be user-friendly. The AnalyzingPython.py gives you the analysis of automobile finace.
### ImportantExcelProgram.py was used to transfer the data (down payments and it's total payments) to the excel so that we can create the scatter plots to analysis the data. The data for credit score and its total payments as well as the loan term payments and its total was transfered through the GUI.
