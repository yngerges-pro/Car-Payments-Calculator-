# Run the SQL2520CODE(1).py to see how it works
## Make sure that the AnalyzingPython.py is in the same directory as the SQL2520CODE(1).py so that it works
## Make sure that the car.xlsx is also in the same directory as the SQL2520CODE(1).py so that it works
## It calculates the total and Monthly payments. Saves your data in excel and mySQL. Data in excel is used so that the user can view previous data while mySQL is used to be viewed by the developers.
## The SQL2520CODE(1).py is created to be user-friendly. AnalyzingPython.py gives you an analysis of automobile finance.
## ImportantExcelProgram.py was used to transfer the data (down payments and total payments) to excel so that we can create the scatter plots to analyze the data. The data for credit score and its total payments as well as the loan term payments and its total was transferred through the GUI.
